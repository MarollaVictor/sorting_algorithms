Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides a way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements in relation to the size of the input data. Understanding Big O notation is crucial for developers and computer scientists, as it helps in evaluating the efficiency of algorithms and making informed decisions about code optimization.

Key Concepts

Time Complexity: Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Common complexities include:
O(1): Constant time
O(log n): Logarithmic time
O(n): Linear time
O(n log n): Linearithmic time
O(nÂ²): Quadratic time
O(2^n): Exponential time

Space Complexity: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size.

Worst, Best, and Average Cases: Big O notation typically describes the worst-case scenario, but it can also be used to analyze the best and average cases of algorithm performance.
